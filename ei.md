## Evaluating Emotional Intelligence

Most large companies today have employed trained psychologists to develop what are known 
as “competency models” to aid them in identifying, training, and promoting likely stars 
in the leadership firmament. The pshychologists have also developed such models for lower-
level positions. And in recent years, I have analyzed competency models from 188 compannes.

In carrying out this work, my objective was to determine which personal capabilities 
drove outstanding performance within these organizations, and to what degree they did so.
I grouped capabilities into three categories: purely technical skills like accounting and
business planning; cognitive abilities like analytical reasoning and competencies 
demonstrating emotional intelligence, such as the ability to work with others and 
effectiveness in leading change.

To create some of the competency models, psychologists askked senior managers and the 
companies to identify the capabilities that typified the organization's most outstanding 
leaders. To create other models, the psychologists used objective criteria, such as a 
division's profitability, to differentiate the start performers at senior levels within
their organizations from the average ones. Those individuals were then extensively 
interviewed and tested, and their capabilities were compared. This process resulted in
the creation of lists of ingredients for hightly effective leaders. The lists ranged in 
lenght from seven to 15 items and included such ingredients as initiative and strategic
vision.

### Idea in Brief

What distinguishes great leaders from merely good ones? It isn't IQ or technical skills,
says Daniel Goleman. It's emotional intelligence: a group of five skills that enable the 
best leaders to maximize their own and their followers' performance. When senior managers
at one company had a critical mass of EI capabilities, hteir divisions outperformed yearly
earnings goals by 20%.

#### The EI skills are:

- Self-awarness - knowing one's strenghts, weaknesses, drives, values and impact on others
- Self-regulation - controlling or redirecting disruptive impulses and moods
- Motivation - relishing achievement for its own sake
- Empathy - understanding other people's emotional makeup
- Social skills - building rapport with others to move them in desired directions

We're each born with certain levels of EI skills. But we can strengthen these abilities
through persistence, practice, and feedback from colleagues or coaches.

When I anazyzed all this data, I found dramatic results. To be sure, intellect was a 
driver of outstanding performance. Cognitive skills such as bit-picture thinking and
long-term vision were particularly important. But when I calculated the ratio of technical
skills, IQ, and emotional intelligence as ingredients of excellent performance, emotional
intelligence proved to be twice as important as the others for jobs at all levels. 

Moreover, my analysis showed that emotional intelligence played an increasingly
important role at the highest levels of the company, where differences in technical skills
are of negligible importance. In other words, the higher the rank of a person considered
to be a star performer, the more emotional intelligence capabilities showed up as the 
reason for his or her effectiveness. When I compared star performers with average ones 
in senior leadership postion, nearly 90% of the difference in their profiles was 
attributable to emotional intelligence factors rather than cognitive abilities. 

### Idea in Practice

#### Understanding EI's Components

| EI Component | Definition | Hallmarks | Example |
| -- | -- | -- | -- |
| Self-awarness | Knowing one's emotions, strenghts, weaknesses, drives, values, and goals - and their impact on others | *Self-confidence *Realistics self-assessment *Self-deprecating sense of humor *Thirst for constructive criticism | A manager knows tight deadlines bring out the worst in him. So he plans his time to get work done well in advance. |
| Self-regulation | Controlling or redirecting disruptive emotions and impulses | * Trustworthiness * Integrity * Comfor with ambiguity and change | When a team botches a presentation, its leader resists the urge to scream. Instead, she considers possible reasons for faliure, explains the consequences to her team, and explores solutions with them. |
Motivation | Being driven to achieve for the sake of achievement | * A passion for the work itself and for new challanges * Unflagging energy to improve | Optimism in the face of failure | A portfolio manager at an investment company sees his fund tumble for three consecutive quaters. Major clients defect. Instead of blaming external circumstances, she decides to learn from the experience - and egineeers a turnaround. |
Empathy | Considering others' feelings, especially when making decisions | * Expertise in attracting and retainig talent * Ability to develop others * Sensitivity to cross-cultural differences | An American consultant and her team pitch a project to a potential client in Japan. Her team interprets the client's silence as disapproval, and prepares to leave. The consultant reads the client's body language and senses interest. She continues the meeting, and her teams gets the job. |
Social Skill | Managing relationships to move people in desired directions | * Effectiveness in leading change * Persuasiveness * Extensive networking * Experience in building and leading teams | A manager wants his company to adopt a better Internet strategy. He finds kindred spirits and assembles a de facto team to create prototype Web site. He persuades allies in other divisions to fund the company's participation in a relevant convention. His company forms an Internet division - and puts him in charge of it. |

### Strengthening Your EI

#### Use practice and feedback from others to strengthen specific EI skills.

Example: An executive learned from others that she lacked empathy, especially the ability
to listen. She wanted to fix the problem, so she asked a coach ot tell her when she 
exhibited poor listening skills. She then role-played incidents to practice giving 
better responses; for example, not interrupting. She also began observing executives 
skilled at listening - and imitated their behaviour.

## The five components of emotional intelligence at work

| | Definition | Hallmarks | 
| -- | -- | -- |
| Self-awarness | The ability to recognize and understand your moods, emotions, and drivers, as well as their effect on others. | Self-confidence Realistic self-assessment Self-deprecating sense of humor |
| Self-regulation | The ability to control or redirect disruptive impulses and moods The propernsity to suspend judgment - to think before acting | Trustworthiness and integrity Comfort with ambiguity Openness to change |
| Motivation | A passion to work for reasons that go beyond money or status A propensity to pursue goals with energy and persistence | Strong drive to achieve Optimism, even in the face of failure Organizational commitment |
| Empathy | The ability to understand the emotional makeup of other people Skill in treating people according to their emotional reactions | Expertise in building and retaining talent Cross-cultural sensitivity Service to clients and customers |
| Social skill | Proficiency in managing relationships and building networks An ability to find common ground and build rapport | Effectiveness in leading change Persuasiveness Expertise in building and leading teams |

Other researches have confirmed that emotional intelligence not only distinguishes 
outstanding leaders but can also be linked to strong performance. The findings of the 
late David McClelland, the renowned researcher in human and organizational behavior, are
a good example. In a 1996 study of a global food and beverage company, McClelland found 
that when senior managers had a critical mass of emotional intellegence capabilities,
their divisions outperformed yearly earnings goals by 20%. Meanwhile, division leaders
Meanwhile, division leaders without that critical mass underperformed by almost the 
same amount. McCelland's findings, interestingly, held as true in the company's U.S. 
division as in its division in Asia and Europe.

In short, the numbers are beginning to tell us a persuasive story about the link between
a complany's success and the emotional intelligence of its leaders. And just as
important, research is also demonstrating that people can, if they take the right approach,
develop their emotional intelligence.

### Self-Awareness

Self-awareness is the first component of emotional intellifence - which makes when one
considers that the Delphic oracle gave the advice to "know yourself" thousands of years
ago. Self-awarness means having a deep understanding of one's emotions, strengths, 
weaknesses, needs, and drives. People with strong self-awarness are neither overly 
critical nor unrealistically hopeful. Rather, they are honest - with themselves and 
with others. 

People who have a high degree of self-awarnesses recognize how their feelings affect
them, others people, and their job performances. Thus, a self-aware person who knows that
tight deadlines bring out the worsk in him plans his time carefully and gets his work
done well in advance. Another person with high self-awarnesses will be able to work with 
a demanding client. She will understand the client's impact on her moods and the deeper
reasons for her frustration. "Their trivial demands take us away from the real work that
needs to be done", she might explain. And she will go one step further and turn her 
answer into something constructive.

## Can Emotional Intellegence Be Learned? 

FOR AGES, PEOPLE HAVE DEBATED if leaders are born or made. So too goes the debate
about emotional intelligence. Are people born with certain levels of empathy, for 
example, or do they acquire empathy as a result of life's experiences? The answer is both.
Scientific inquiry strongly suggests that there is a genetic component to emotional 
intelligence. Psychological and developmental research indicates that nurture plays a 
role as well. How much of each perhaps will never be known, but research and practice 
clearly demonstrate that emotional intelligence can be learned. 

One thing is certain: EI increases with age. There is an old-fashioned word for the
phenomenon: maturity. Yet even with maturity, some people still need training to enhance
their emotional intelligence. Unfortunately, far too many training programs that intend
to build leadership skills - including emotional intelligence - are a waste of time and
money. The problem is simple: They focus on the wrong part of the brain.

EI is born largely in the neurotransmitters of the brain's limbic system, which 
governs feelings, impulses, and drivers. Research indicates that the limbic system learns
best through motivation, extended practice, and feedback. Compare this with the kind of
learning that goes on in the neocortex, which governs analytical and technical ability.
The neocortex grasps concepts and logic. It is the part of the brain that figures out 
how to use a computer or make a sales call by reading a book. Not surprisingly - but 
mistakenly - it is also the part of the brain targeted by most training programs aimed
at enhancing emotional intelligence. When such programs take, in effect, a neocortical
approach, my research with the Consortium for Research on Emotional Intelligence in 
Organizations has shown they can even have a negative impact on people's job performance.

To enhance emotional intelligence, organizations must refocus their training to 
include the limbic system. They must help people break old behavioral habits and 
establish new ones. That not only takes much more time than conventional training
programs, it also requires and individualized approach.

Imagine an executive who is thought to be low on empathy by her colleagues. Part of 
that deficit shows itself as an inability to listen; she interrupts people and doesn't
pay close attention to what they're saying. To fix the problem, the executive needs
to be motivated to change, and then she needs practice and feedback from others in the
company. A colleague or coach could be tapped to let the executive know then she has been
observed failing to listen. She would then have to replay the incident and give a better
response; that is, demonstrate her ability to absorb what others are saying. And the
executive could be directed to observe certain executives who listen well and to mimic 
their behavior. 

With persistence and practice, such a process can lead to lasteing results. I know one 
Wall Street executive who sought to improve his empathy - specifically his ability to 
read people's reactions and see their perspectives. Before beginning his quest, the 
executive's subordinates were terrified of working with him. People even went so far as
to hide bad news from him. Naturally, he was shocked when finally confronted with these
facts. He went home and told his family - but they only confirmed what he had heard at 
work. When their opinions on any given subject did not mesh with his, they too, were 
frightened of him.

Enlisting the help of a coach, the executive went to work to heighten his empathy through
practice and feedback. His first step was to take a vacation to a foreign country where 
he did not speak the language. While there, he monitored his reactions to the unfamiliar
and his openness to people who were different form him. When he returned home, humbled by
his week abroad, the executive asked his coach to shadow him for parts of the day, several
times a week, to critique how he treated people with new or different perspectives. At the
same time, he consciously used on-the-job interactions as opportutities to practice
"hearing" ideas that differed from him. Finally, the executive had himself videotaped in
meetings and asked those who worked for and with him to critique his ability to 
asknowledge and understand the feelings of others. It took several months, but the 
executive's emotional intelligence did ultimately rise, and the improvement was reflected
in his overall performance on the job.

It's important to emphasize that building one's EI cannot - will not - happen without
sincere desire and concerted effort. A brief seminar won't help; nor can one buy a how-to
manual. It is much harder to learn to empathize - to internalize empathy as a natural 
response to people - than it is to become adept at regression analysis. But it can be done.
"Nothing great was ever archived without enthusiasm," wrote Ralph Waldo Emerson. If your
goar is to become a real reader, these words can serve as a guidepost in your efforts to
develop high emotional intelligence.

Self-awarness extends to a person's understanding of his or her values and goals. Someone
who is highly self-aware knows where he is headed and why; so, for example, he will be
able to be firm in turning down a job offer that is tempting financially but does not fit
with his principles or long-term goals. A person who lacks self-awareness is apt to make
decisions that bring on inner turmoil by treading on buried values. "The money looked 
good so I signed on," someone might say two years into a job, "but the work means so 
little to me that I'm constantly bored." The decisions of self-aware people mesh with
their values; consequently, they often find work to be energizing.

How can one recognize self-awarness? First and foremost it shows itself as candor and an
ability to assess oneself realistically. People with high self-awarness are able to speak
accurately and openly - althrough not necessarily effusively or confessionally - about 
their emotions and the impact they have on their work. For instance, one manager I know of
was skeptical about a new personal-shopper service that her company, a major department-
store chain, was about to introduce. Without promping from her team or her boss, she 
offered them an explanation: "It's hard for me to get behind the rollout of this service,"
she admitted, "because I really wanted to run the project, but I wasn't selected. Bear
with me while I deal with that." The manager did indeed examine her feelings; a week later,
she was supporting the project fully. 

Such self-knowledge often shows itself in the hiring process. Ask a candidate to describe
a time he got carried away by his feelings and did something he later regretted. Self-aware
candidates will be frank in admitting to failure - and will often tell their tales with
a smile. One of the hallmarks of self-awareness is a self-deprecating sense of humour.

Self-awarness can also be indentified during performance reviews. Self-aware people know-
and are comfortable talking about - their limitations and strengths, and they often 
demonstrate a thirst for constructive criticism. By contrast, people with low self-
awarness interpret the messages that they need to improve as a threat or a signal of
failure.

Self-aware people can also be recognized by their slef-confidence. They have a firm grasp
of their capabilities and are less likely to set themselves up to a fail by, for example,
overstretching on assignments. They know, too, when to ask for help. And the risks they
take on the job are calculated. They won't ask for a challenge that they know can't handle
alone. They'll play to their strenghts.

Consider the actions of a midlevel employee who was invited to sit in on a strategy 
meeting with her company's top executives. Although she was the most junior person in the
room, she did not sit there quietly, listening in awestruck of fearful silence. She knew
she had a head for clear login and the skill to present ideas percuasively, and she 
offered cogent suggestions aobut the company's strategy. At the same time, her self-
awarness stopped her from wandering into territory where she knew she was weak.

Despite the value of having self-aware people in the workplace, my research indicates 
that senior executives don't often give self-awarness the credit it deserves when they
look for potential leaders. Many executives mistake candor about feelings for "wimpiness"
and fail to give due respect to employees who openly acknowledge their shortcomings. Such
people are too readily dismissed as "not tough enought" to lead others.

In fact, the opposite is true. In the first place, people generally admire and respect 
candor. Furthermore, leaders are constantly required to make judgment calls that require
to make judgment calls that require a candid assessment of capabilities - their own and 
those of others. Do we have the management expertise to acquire a competitor? Can we 
launch a new product within six months? People who assess themselves honeslty - that is, 
self-aware people - are well sited to do the same for the organization they run.
